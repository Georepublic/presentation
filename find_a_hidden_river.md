# What is this data?
The river name is "渋谷川暗渠"(Shibuyagawa-Ankyo).

Shibuyagawa is mean "Shibuya river", what is Ankyo?

---
# Ankyo
Ankyo is "blind ditch" or "underground drain".

I don't know about Ankyo until searching in Google:-(

# in Google

I found that:

> Shibuya river is covered with concrete when Tokyo Olympics in 1964.

We need to research using a map before 1960s.

# Old map

I use "今昔散歩"(Konjaku-sampo) application.

It is a smartphone application for iOS or Android.

It can show three maps(Edo era (1603-1867) map, Meiji era (1868-1912) map, and OS's map).
